Aug_1,Online therapy,"Online therapy, also known as teletherapy or virtual therapy, involves providing mental health services and support over the internet. It offers a convenient and accessible way for individuals to receive therapy through various platforms such as video calls, phone calls, chat, or email, making it particularly beneficial for those with geographic, physical, or time constraints. This form of therapy is especially useful for individuals in remote or underserved areas, those with busy schedules, or those who prefer the privacy of their own homes.",No,+84%,90500,Regular,Accelerating,High,Low,Positive,Growing,Past 15 years,https://explodingtopics.com/topic/online-therapy-1,"LinkedIn: 75.18, TikTok: 9.65, YouTube: 22.88, Instagram: 100.00, Twitter: 9.93, Facebook: 48.00, Reddit: 17.01, Pinterest: 38.25","08/01/2009: 50405, 09/01/2009: 50405, 10/01/2009: 53841, 11/01/2009: 49259, 12/01/2009: 43531, 01/01/2010: 56132, 02/01/2010: 51550, 03/01/2010: 53841, 04/01/2010: 53841, 05/01/2010: 53841, 06/01/2010: 50405, 07/01/2010: 49259, 08/01/2010: 49259, 09/01/2010: 46968, 10/01/2010: 48113, 11/01/2010: 45822, 12/01/2010: 42386, 01/01/2011: 53841, 02/01/2011: 46968, 03/01/2011: 49259, 04/01/2011: 50405, 05/01/2011: 49259, 06/01/2011: 48113, 07/01/2011: 52696, 08/01/2011: 51550, 09/01/2011: 52696, 10/01/2011: 50405, 11/01/2011: 48113, 12/01/2011: 42386, 01/01/2012: 54987, 02/01/2012: 50405, 03/01/2012: 48113, 04/01/2012: 50405, 05/01/2012: 51550, 06/01/2012: 48113, 07/01/2012: 50405, 08/01/2012: 52696, 09/01/2012: 53841, 10/01/2012: 53841, 11/01/2012: 49259, 12/01/2012: 43531, 01/01/2013: 52696, 02/01/2013: 54987, 03/01/2013: 58424, 04/01/2013: 59569, 05/01/2013: 60715, 06/01/2013: 69879, 07/01/2013: 69879, 08/01/2013: 89354, 09/01/2013: 106537, 10/01/2013: 93936, 11/01/2013: 71025, 12/01/2013: 53841, 01/01/2014: 72170, 02/01/2014: 59569, 03/01/2014: 57278, 04/01/2014: 52696, 05/01/2014: 50405, 06/01/2014: 50405, 07/01/2014: 50405, 08/01/2014: 50405, 09/01/2014: 52696, 10/01/2014: 54987, 11/01/2014: 56132, 12/01/2014: 44677, 01/01/2015: 50405, 02/01/2015: 46968, 03/01/2015: 51550, 04/01/2015: 49259, 05/01/2015: 44677, 06/01/2015: 45822, 07/01/2015: 46968, 08/01/2015: 44677, 09/01/2015: 49259, 10/01/2015: 48113, 11/01/2015: 48113, 12/01/2015: 42386, 01/01/2016: 46968, 02/01/2016: 51550, 03/01/2016: 45822, 04/01/2016: 45822, 05/01/2016: 50405, 06/01/2016: 43531, 07/01/2016: 46968, 08/01/2016: 45822, 09/01/2016: 50405, 10/01/2016: 42386, 11/01/2016: 50405, 12/01/2016: 44677, 01/01/2017: 52696, 02/01/2017: 53841, 03/01/2017: 53841, 04/01/2017: 49259, 05/01/2017: 51550, 06/01/2017: 49259, 07/01/2017: 49259, 08/01/2017: 46968, 09/01/2017: 51550, 10/01/2017: 50405, 11/01/2017: 51550, 12/01/2017: 46968, 01/01/2018: 56132, 02/01/2018: 56132, 03/01/2018: 49259, 04/01/2018: 49259, 05/01/2018: 51550, 06/01/2018: 49259, 07/01/2018: 52696, 08/01/2018: 56132, 09/01/2018: 53841, 10/01/2018: 50405, 11/01/2018: 48113, 12/01/2018: 41240, 01/01/2019: 53841, 02/01/2019: 50405, 03/01/2019: 51550, 04/01/2019: 52696, 05/01/2019: 49259, 06/01/2019: 51550, 07/01/2019: 51550, 08/01/2019: 52696, 09/01/2019: 58424, 10/01/2019: 52696, 11/01/2019: 56132, 12/01/2019: 48113, 01/01/2020: 64151, 02/01/2020: 64151, 03/01/2020: 87063, 04/01/2020: 114556, 05/01/2020: 101955, 06/01/2020: 95082, 07/01/2020: 91645, 08/01/2020: 87063, 09/01/2020: 82481, 10/01/2020: 77898, 11/01/2020: 71025, 12/01/2020: 73316, 01/01/2021: 82481, 02/01/2021: 77898, 03/01/2021: 72170, 04/01/2021: 76753, 05/01/2021: 79044, 06/01/2021: 74462, 07/01/2021: 75607, 08/01/2021: 81335, 09/01/2021: 82481, 10/01/2021: 81335, 11/01/2021: 79044, 12/01/2021: 75607, 01/01/2022: 90500, 02/01/2022: 88208, 03/01/2022: 83626, 04/01/2022: 82481, 05/01/2022: 83626, 06/01/2022: 79044, 07/01/2022: 82481, 08/01/2022: 84772, 09/01/2022: 81335, 10/01/2022: 83626, 11/01/2022: 75607, 12/01/2022: 75607, 01/01/2023: 91645, 02/01/2023: 87063, 03/01/2023: 80189, 04/01/2023: 76753, 05/01/2023: 85917, 06/01/2023: 89354, 07/01/2023: 85917, 08/01/2023: 88208, 09/01/2023: 83626, 10/01/2023: 83626, 11/01/2023: 82481, 12/01/2023: 81335, 01/01/2024: 88208, 02/01/2024: 89354, 03/01/2024: 91645, 04/01/2024: 83626, 05/01/2024: 82481, 06/01/2024: 85917, 07/01/2024: 90500","technology,health,mental-health,telecommunication,healthcare",Current
